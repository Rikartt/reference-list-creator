# Reference List Creator

The goal is to create a simple, relatively easy to use reference list creator tool that takes the input of a txt file with links to studies/papers and outputs a nice reference list in the chosen style. I'll do it in APA 7.

# Roadmap

- [X] Make the script read the links
- [ ] Make the script go through a link, retrieve the correct information for a reference, and then output it
  - [ ] This will be done by retrieving a DOI when possible, and when a DOI isn't available it should retrieve the reference info by other means
- [ ] Make the script output the finished list of all the references into a txt file. 
- [ ] When finished, maybe make it even output the reference list to a word file and correctly format everything.
